Start the test server for the single bot with:
xpilots -map maps/obstacle1.xp -noQuit -port 15352


All tasks start with the keyword "mission".

Make the bot attack the closest, unspecified enemy - "mission attack nearest"
Make the bot attack a specified enemy named "CoolGuy64" - "mission attack ship CoolGuy64"
Make the bot go to a coordinate on the map, in this case x=35, y=128 - "mission move to 35 128"

The single bot (multiguy.py) will always start roaming after idling (having no instructions) for a specific amount of ticks.
When roaming, the ship will go to random coordinates on the map. 
The bot will decide to go out of roaming mode if a target is nearby and an "mission attack nearest" has been given at any point.
