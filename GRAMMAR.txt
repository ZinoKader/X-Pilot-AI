All tasks start with the keyword "mission".

Make the bot attack the closest, unspecified enemy - "mission attack nearest"
Make the bot attack a specified enemy named "CoolGuy64" - "mission attack ship CoolGuy64"
Make the bot go to a coordinate on the map, in this case x=35, y=128 - "mission move to 35 128"

The single bot (multiguy.py) will always start roaming after idling (having no instructions) for a specific amount of ticks.
